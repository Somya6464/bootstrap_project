# bootstrap_project

1. First we add bootStrap Css & Js link.
2. Then understand BreakPoints(These are the diff. screen sizes {xxl, xl, lg, md, sm, xs} that are helpful when we work on responsiveness and 
   make ui diff. according to the diff. screen sizes at all.)
3. Then we use Row and Column In this they have 12 parts (1 to 12) by 
   dividing those part in diff. order we can make diff. layouts and designs 
   or components in our site.
4. each row & column have by default padding of -12px and 12px in BST.
5. **AUTO COLUMN LAYOUT**
    a. In this we work on Column dividation according to the row, this can help to set the Grid Layout as well

6. Gutter Classes :- These classes are used give spacing b/w to elements 
   those are horizontal (gx-4)/vertical(gy-4)
7. Margin/Padding :- mx (1-5), my(1-5)
